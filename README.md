### Hi there 👋

- I´m 22 years old 😄

- Mexican 🇲🇽

- My hobbies are reading, playing videogames, swimming, 
hanging out with my friends, learning about science and technology, robotic and all referent to STEM. 🤖

I´m a Computer Systems Engineering student, preparing to be a Back-End Developer thanks to Oracle and Alura Latam through the Oracle ONE program. Currently I'm not working, although I'm in several certification courses related to my career such as MIT OCW, Google Garage Digital, Microsoft Learn and Harvard CS50 to mention a few.
